# Emilia-Inventory

This is a program to keep track of things without using a primitive Text File to keep track of it.
I want to automate the task of keeping track of belongings as much as possible.

There are 2 versions that are going to be available.

C++ Version: Will create Text Files that store information where it can also be added and read through the Terminal. 
SQL Version: Database with premade Queries and Tables which can be expanded for any need.
